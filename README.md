# English Premier League Exploration
## by Mathias Brønd Sørensen


## Dataset

The dataset is a SQLite database describing football matches, players and teams from Europe and is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer).

In order to limit the dataset and make it tidy, the following operations were performed:
1. Joining relevant tables to denormalize data
2. Limiting rows to only be matches in the English Premier League
3. Limit number of features by removing excessive ones
4. Added catagorical variable to indicate result
5. Ordered catagorical variable season as it is ordinal
